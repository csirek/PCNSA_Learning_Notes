  Cortex Data Lake
- SD-WAN integration

- VM-Series
- Prisma Access
  Cloud-based firewall
- Physical Appliances

# Processing Architecture

- Single-Pass Parallel Processing (SP3)
  Simultaneous traffic classification & enforcement
  Full-stack single-pass inspection

- Traffic Planes
  Palo Alto splits hardware resources between two traffic planes
- Control
  Configuration, logging, reporting
- Data
  Signature matching, security & network processing

# Management Options

- Web Interface
  Local - http ot https from local PC
  Centralized - Panorama

- CLI
  Console, SSH, Telnet

- API
  XML
  REST

- Management Port
  Special interface designed for administration
  Part of the Control Plane
- Data ports also support management functions
  Management Profiles
  Service Routes

# Service Routes

- Required to provide access to external services through data ports
  Device > Setup > Services > Service Route Configuration > Customize

# Firewall CLI

- Palo Alto firewalls use two CLI modes
  Operational - Basic networking/system commands & verification
  Configuration - Accessible via configure

- CLI Enhancements
  Use find to figure out the command syntax
  Use "?"
  Use the "Tab" key
  Use the "|" symbol along with match or except for output filtering
+ - command needs a value
* - this is required to run a command
> - more options to choose

# Configuration Files

- Running Configuration
  Current configuration enforced in the Data Plane
  Control the firewall's behavior
  Saved to running-config.xml

- Candidate Configuration
  Temporary configuration stored in the memory in the Control Plane
  Saved as either default snapshot.xml or as a custom XML file
  Requires a commit

- Revert to Last Saved Configuration
  Replaces current candidate configuration settings with a saved candidate configuration file
- Revert to Running Configuration
  Replaces current candidate configuration settings with the current running configuration
- Load
  Overwrites the current candidate configuration with a config file
- Export
  Exports a Current/Running Configuration file as an XML (backups)
- Import, Save

# Dynamic Updates

- Keep the system up-to-date with latest threats, applications & more

# General Configuration

- Device > Setup > Management
  Hostname
  Domain
  Login Banner

- Device > Setup > Operations
  SNMP

- Device > Setup > Services
  DNS
  NTP

# Admin Roles

- Define the type of access that an administrator has to the firewall
  Dynamic - based on pre-built profiles
  Role Based - Custoner access for granular control

- Configuration
  Device > Administrators
  Device > Admin Roles

# Data Interfaces

- PAN-OS supports several types of interfaces and can operate in multiple deployments
  Tap, Virtual Wire, Layer 2, Layer 3

- Tap
  Works on a copy of network traffic
  Port mirroring (SPAN)
  Deployed for logging & visibility

- Virtual Wire
  For inline deployments
  Traffic control, decryption, QoS, etc.
  A logical connection of two ports
  No L2/L3 addresses
  No management capabilities
  Easy to integrate
  Allows for subinterfaces
- Virtual Wire interfaces must be attached to a Virtual Wire Object
  Default Virtual Wire ports may need to be removed

- Layer 2
  Used for L2 switching
  Inline
  Require a VLAN Object
  Support subinterfaces

- Layer 3
  Used for L3 routing (IPv4, IPv6)
  Inline
  Require a Virtual Router
  Support subinterfaces & management

- Other interfcaes

- Loopback
  Virtual L3 ports internal to the firewall
  Used in many scenarios
  Routing, DNS sinkholes & more

- Tunnel
  Virtual interface used for VPN representation

# Virtual Router

- Enables routing functions
  Interfaces
  RIB - Control Plane
  FIB - Data Plane

- Supported Routing Technologies
  Static routes
  OSPF, OSPFv3, BGP, RIP
  PIM-SM, PIN-ASM, PIM-SSM, IGMP version 1/2/3

# Security Zones

- A group of interfaces representing a segment controlled by the firewall
  LAN1, Internet, etc.

- A firewall interface can belong to only one zone
  Interface type & zone type must match
  Zone-unassigned interface does not process traffic

- Zones affects the data traffic
  Intra-zone - allowed by default
  Inter-zone - Policy Rule to allow packets through

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			### Palo Alto Firewall Policies ###
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Policies Overview

- Enforce rules & actions to safely enable applications
- Supported Policies
  Security
  NAT
  QoS
  Policy Based Forwarding
  Decryption
  Application Override
  Authentication
  DoS Protection
  Tunnel Inspection
  SD-WAN

# Policy Rules

- Polices are defined through Rules
  Common Criteria
  Conditions & Actions

- General Rule Processing
  Top-down until a match is found

# Security Policy Overview

- Primary traffic control mechanism
  Configured through Rules
    Attribute-based
      Source/Destination Zone, Addresses, Applications & more
    Top-down evaluation
      First-match processing logic
      Add specific rules first

# Security Policy Rules

- Rule Components
  Name
  Source/Destination Zone
  Rule Type: Intrazone, Interzone, Universal (Intra + Inter)
  Source/Destination Address
  User
  HIP Profile
  Application
  Service: Select, any, applicaton-default
  URL Category
  Profile Setting: Only for "Allow" rules
  Tag
  Other Settings: Description, Audit, Comment, Logging, QoS
  Action

- Action Types
  Allow
  Deny: Block traffic; Based on the application's default Deny Action
  Drop: Silently drops the application; Optionally sends ICMP Unreachable (used in UDP based applications)
  Reset: Client, Server, Both; Optionally sends ICMP Unreachable (used in UDP based applications)

- Default Rules
  The last two (pre-defined) rules of the Policy
  Intrazone-default
  Interzone-default
  Processed last: Only apply for traffic that does not match any user-defined rules

# Policy Objects

- Containers for representation of discrete data
- Object Types
  Address (Group)/Region
  User (Group)
  Application Group
  Application Filter
  Service (Group)

# Working with Security Policy

- Verification & Troubleshooting
  Device > Troubleshooting > Security Policy Match
  Rule Usage: Hit Count, Last hit, First hit
  Device > Setup > Management > Policy Rulebase Settings

# Verify routing table
  show routing route

# ICMP and ping

- ICMP application - all ICMP messages except echos (ping)
- ping application - ICMP echo
